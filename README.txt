			The Three Fates Game
				 
	Synopsis:
		This game is similar to that of a 20 questions were the machine will guess any Disney related
		character that you can think of. Only, there's a catch. This game will ask for input from it's
		user in order to better itself. The Three Fates Game will continually improve and expand it's 
		database inorder to accomodate larger capacities of characters.

Contents of Directory:

	This directory contains all source code for our "OutOfBox Version". The idea of this version is to 
have a personal database that can be implemented on to any Windows machine with minimal effort.
This allows for an open source product that is easily available to anyone who wishes to use, modify,
and/or enjoy.
	This directory also contains a minimal starter database (only 8 characters). This allows for any one
who wishes to test our product quickly and efficiently without the need for building their own database 
from scratch.
	This directory contains two .bmp files, these files are used as images in the game and aren't of 
much interest for people who aren't looking into the aesthetic pleasures of our product.
